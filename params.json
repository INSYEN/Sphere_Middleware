{"name":"Sphere middleware","tagline":"A python-based middleware for DTNMP control.","body":"Sphere_middleware is the (admittedly uncreative) name for the python-based middleware which composes the core of our DTNMP commanding system.\r\n\r\n#What Is This?\r\nThis package provides an end-to-end solution for DTN network management. It is comprised of three components:\r\n1 dtnmp_commanding - A heavily-modified version of the DTNMP reference implementation from ION, enhanced with RPC, Datalists, and new commanding capabilities for ION. This communicates via TCP with...\r\n2 sphere_middleware - A python middleware which handles all higher-level control of the DTNMP nodes, as well as reporting, archival, simple routing algorithms, etc. This software has an HTTP interface, and communicates with...\r\n3 SphereWebFrontend - An HTML/Javascript based web application, which allows simple control of DTN networks. \r\n\r\nFor installation directions, please see:https://github.com/INSYEN/Sphere_Middleware/wiki/Installation\r\n\r\n#Other repositories:\r\n* The commanding-enable DTNMP client/server installation. https://github.com/INSYEN/dtnmp_commanding/\r\n* The web-based frontend https://github.com/INSYEN/SphereWebFrontend/\r\n\r\n#Who are we?\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
